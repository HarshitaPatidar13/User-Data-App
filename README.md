How to use:
To use my webapp, you can log in with the email "harshipatidar32@gmail.com" and password "Harshita*123". If you don't have an account yet, you can register a new user by clicking the "register here" link on the login page. Once you're logged in, you'll see a list of users on which you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. To add a new user, click on the "add user" button on the right side of the navbar. Each user in the list has a view, edit, and delete icon. Clicking on the view icon will redirect you to another page where you can view all the details of the user. The edit icon will allow you to modify the user's information, and the delete icon will remove the user from the list. Please note that the sign-up page is not accessible when you are logged in. To log out from the webapp, click on the circular profile icon on the right side of the navbar, and then click on the "logout" button.
